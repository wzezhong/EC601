# EC601
This is EC 601 Mini project which I need to downlaod images from twitter api and use google vision api to convert these images to a video.
# Program using
.Python 3.6.5
.Tweepy 3.6.0
.FFMPEG
.Google cloud videointelligence
# User guide
1. You can use the twitterAPI.py first to get tweets and download images from my twitter account.
2. Second, you need to make sure that the directory path is correct. Then put the subprocess command into the twitterAPI.py. After you run    it, it will generate a out.mp4 video. Don't use windows player to play this video. Use some other app to play this video. iTunes is        perfect in my computer.
3. You need to run the videolabel.py fiel to make the google vision api running. And it will print all of description in your command          window.
